                <li>Reaching out to  our veterans and asking them how they are doing</li>
                <li>Wellness checks, actually visiting them or video calling them to ensure that their living arrangement is suitable</li>
                <li>Encouring regular doctor visits for check-ups</li>
            </ul>
