<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<p>
 I built this during a 10-day coding sprint while still a student at DevCodeCamp. It was an eye-opening experience having
 to code thisproject during that short amount of time, but I'm really proud of the end-product. It's meant to be a web 
 application that's used to help raise awareness, provide coping strategies, and allow users to find a VA facility. It's also meant to serve as a place  where veterans can connect with other veterans.

### Prerequisites

1. You'll need the latest version of NPM, Visual Studio, and Visual Studio Code downloaded on your device. (as of September 2021).
2. Have a laptop capable of running the server, and your client port for the local host so that you can actually make API calls.

   `git clone https://github.com/wrightzachary/Capstone-Frontend.git`

2. Install NPM packages
   
   `npm i`
   
3. npm start in both the client and server folder.
4. Give it a moment and the project will start up.
5. In the mean-time, go to the ASP.NET Core Entity Framework backend that I built for this project by following this link: <a href="https://github.com/wrightzachary/Capstone-Backend">;IGY6 Backend</a>
6. Open up the sln file inside of the backend repo that you just downloaded.
7. Run the backend server by hitting on IIS Express inside of Visual Studio.
